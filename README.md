# HTWCleanCoders
Hunt the Wumpus for Clean Coders Acceptance Testing Episodes.

In the spirit of the season, I've modified the game to be Christmas themed.  In this version,
your trying to defeat Krampus, the spirit who punishes bad children at Christmas.

To aid you in your quest, you have ten candy canes you can shoot him with, plus I've added a flashlight
that you can pick up, and which makes you immune to being carried away by the flying monkeys (I think
I got a little carried away there - get it?!)
